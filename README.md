# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Sure! Here's a simple 5-sentence `README.md` description you can use:

---
Ecom Product App

This React app displays a list of products with their names, prices, and descriptions. The main 'App' component uses the 'useState' hook to manage product data and passes it down to child components using props. The 'ProductList' component maps over the product array and renders individual 'ProductItem' components. Each 'ProductItem' receives and displays product details through props. Custom CSS is applied to style the layout and individual product cards for a clean design.
